The code does the following:
1. Creates a ground plane, 20 units by 20 units, and 0.5 units tall.
2. Creates a circular path for main body. Tilts body and moves it up
and down in sinusoidal path while also rotating in circle.
3. Adds main body as yellow rectangular prism.
4. Adds tail to back of body.
5. Adds left wings to left, upper side of body, rotated 90 degrees and
making sure tips are touching each other and touching the body (but not
overlapping in volume).
6. Adds right wings to right, upper side of body, with same restrictions
as #5.
7. Both sets of wings move in sinusoidal pattern and mimicks flapping.
8. Adds left legs to left, lower side of body. Another segment is attached
to the bottom at an angle to the top portion. They are touching but not
overlapping.
9. Adds right legs to right, lower side of body, same restrictions as above.
10. Both sets of legs are moving in sinusoidal pattern inwards and outwards.
11. Adds head to body, opposite tail. Just touching, not overlapping.
12. Adds antennae to head, about 60 degrees from horizontal (relative to body).
Both sets of antennae are touching head, not overlapping.
13. 9 more blocks are added to antennae to make it a string (an actual antenna).
14. A ball is added to each end to signal end of antennae.
